# PollingApp-V1.2
Hello,
If I need to briefly explain the application I developed called Polling, I made a polling application in which students and teachers are included, the lessons taken during the semester are seen, and students see this information from their teachers when they attend and do not attend the lesson during the specified hours.

We have two entrances as admin and student entrance.
When we press each entry, we get the student number or user name, if any, in the user.If not, a new record is created.
Then after the introduction or after the course meets the two sections, which are registered and we want to add the course.When we click on the registered lesson, we can see each week and mark which day of the lesson there is in that week by looking at the time.

You can see which students have marked the course we have marked from the teacher admin login page
